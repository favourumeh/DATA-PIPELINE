#  Data Pipeline: Basketball Reference 

## Note: See file "project_ETL.docx" for further description of the project)


## Basketball Reference Data Pipeline
- Created a data pipeline that can scrape and clean tabular statistical data from BasketballReference.com and store it in a local MySQL server and/or Excel workbook. 
- The pipeline was used to store over 16,000 rows of per-game statistics of players in National Basketball Association (NBA) spanning 31 years (from 1990-2021)
- The stored data was then used in several machine learning projects namely regression and classification (see [Predicting Turnovers](https://github.com/favourumeh/Multiple_Linear_Regression---Predicting-Turnovers-) project and [Identifying Player Position](https://github.com/favourumeh/Identifying-Player-Position) project)  
- The NBA is the top professional basketball league in North America. It was founded in 1947 and is currently home to the best basketball players in the world. 
- Basketball Reference is an online depository of basketball statistics, game logs etc for different basketball leagues.
